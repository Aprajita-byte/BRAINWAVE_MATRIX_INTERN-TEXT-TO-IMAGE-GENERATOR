# Text-to-Image Generator

## Overview
The **Text-to-Image Generator** is an AI-powered tool that converts textual descriptions into high-quality images using deep learning models. This project leverages state-of-the-art generative models to create realistic and artistic images based on user input.

## Features
- Converts text prompts into detailed images
- Supports various styles and resolutions
- Customizable parameters for fine-tuning output
- User-friendly interface with API support
- Open-source and extensible

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Pip
- CUDA (for GPU acceleration, optional but recommended)

### Setup
